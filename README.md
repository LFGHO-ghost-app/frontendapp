<!-- Repositories Structure   -->


# Repositories Structure

The Boo project is composed of four individual repositories, each playing a crucial role in bringing our vision to life.

   - The mobile application front-end for GhostPay. Provides users with a user-friendly interface for interacting with Boo's smart wallet and exploring the decentralized marketplace.

2. [BackendAPI](https://github.com/LFGHO-ghost-app/BackendAPI)
   - The backbone of Boo. This repository contains the API that facilitates communication between the Boo mobile app and the backend components. Manages transaction requests, payment generation, and security protocols.

3. [BackendAccount](https://github.com/LFGHO-ghost-app/BackendAccount)

## Purpose of Smart Wallet and Marketplace Integration:

The integration of Boo's smart wallet and the decentralized marketplace serves as a proof of concept, showcasing the synergy between a secure, gasless payment system and a user-friendly marketplace. This integration allows us to test and refine the Boo concept, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing a seamless, cost-free, and secure web3 transaction experience.
